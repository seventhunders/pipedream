Linux
=====

Zebedee is developed and tested on Mandrake 8.2. It should build easily on
other Linux distributions too although older versions (RedHat 5, I believe)
may have problems with one or more of the pthread library functions being
missing. Compile without HAVE_PTHREADS defined if this appears to be a
problem.

You may build with system-supplied zlib, bzip2 and OpenSSL (for Blowfish)
libraries if you have them.

Zebedee:

    Modify the locations of the Blowfish, Zlib and bzip2 libraries,
    include files and installation directories, if necessary, and
    then type "make OS=linux".
    
blowfish-0.9.5a:

    Builds without modification to the Makefile. Use "make optmimze" to build
    the best version for your platform.
    
zlib-1.1.4:

    Configure and build using:

	./configure; make

bzip2-1.0.1:

    Follow the instructions in the README file

Other UNIX-like systems
=======================

In general, follow any instructions given with the distributions of each of
the libraries Zebedee depends on. Zebedee itself has been built and tested, at
some point or other, on:

	Solaris -- use "make OS=solaris"
	FreeBSD -- use "make OS=freebsd"
	Tru64 UNIX -- use "make OS=tru64"
	HPUX -- use "make OS=hpux"
	Irix -- use "make OS=irix"
	MacOS X -- use "make OS=macosx"

I have received reports of Zebedee being built successfully under AIX
(some AIX-related changes have been made to the base code) and SCO Unix.  I
will happily incorporate changes for other platforms if you can supply the
necessary differences.

As a first stab you can try "make OS=generic" to build a generic UNIX-type
version without using pthreads. See comments in the Makefile for definitions
that you might want to tweak.

Windows
=======

Zebedee was built using the Cygwin tools (http://sourceware.cygnus.com) and
the "mingw32" version of gcc (see http://www.mingw.org).

Zebedee is now built to use MSVCRT.DLL.

Zebedee:

    Modify the locations of the Blowfish, GMP and Zlib libraries, include
    files and installation directories, if necessary and then type
    "make OS=win32".

blowfish-0.9.5a:

    Ensure that you build with the Mingw32 compiler and then "make".
    The "make optimize" doesn't appear to work well under Cygwin, if you
    really want to try to optimize performance do "make bf_opts" and
    then run bf_opts.
	
zlib-1.1.4:

    Run "configure" and then make. It's a breeze!

bzip2-1.0.1:

    Follow the instructions in the README file.

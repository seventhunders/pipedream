This is a slightly mofified repackaging of the Blowfish library code taken
from OpenSSL-0.9.5a (hence the version of the library). All of the assembler
code has been removed and the Makefile simplified. One or two files have been
"tweaked" to remove dependencies on the OpenSLL environment.

To build, make whatever changes you need to the Makefile (nothing if you
use gcc) and build the library. After doing that do a "make optimize" to
rebuild it with the best compiler flags for your platform.
